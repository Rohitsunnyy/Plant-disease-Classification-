# Plant Disease Classification

## Project Overview
This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify plant diseases from images, aiming to enhance agricultural productivity by enabling early detection and treatment of diseases through automated AI methods.

## Features
- **Disease Identification:** Advanced CNN architectures to identify and classify plant diseases.
- **Image Processing:** Pre-processing techniques to improve image data quality for accurate classification.
- **Accuracy and Validation:** High accuracy in disease detection with extensive validation across diverse plant images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV for image processing

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohitsunnyy/Plant-disease-Classification-
cd Plant-disease-Classification-
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
```python
python train.py  # To train the model
python predict.py  # To predict using a trained model
